Speaker notes:
- Open by showing the animated gradients — they're rendered directly in the Stage, so the live deck will look identical.
- Walk through the three feature bullets (Stage-aware layouts, Copilot choreography, Version-native decks) and tie them to real customer wins.
- Highlight the metrics row: 24 slides shipped this week, 132 Copilot prompts with an 84% adoption rate, and a 9.4 audience score.
- Use the timeline to describe the creative loop (Ideate → Compose → Rehearse) and how Copilot accelerates each step.
- Close with the status pills: everything is synced to the 1280×720 Stage, autosave is on, animations are pre-baked, and Copilot is standing by.
